## NeighborNet - Community-Based Social Platform

# **What is NeighborNet?**
NeighborNet is a Django-based web application that brings people from the same locality together into virtual community groups. It provides features such as event announcements, local business advertisements, second-hand product sales, and service requests. It aims to foster a sense of community and encourage local business support through an easy-to-use platform.
